This folder contains the actual results of completing the tasks in the project ___0x19. C - STACKS, QUEUES - LIFO, FIFO.___

The scope of this project was to create a program that interpretes Monty ByteCode Scripts (typically *.m files). The program is named monty, and this folder contains the source code files for it. Unlike most other prior projects in the ALX SE course, each task in this project simply added extra functionality to the program, so there aren't separate files for each task here.

### Mandatory Tasks
> There are six (6) mandatory tasks in all.

### Advanced Tasks
> There are fourteen (14) advanced tasks in all.
